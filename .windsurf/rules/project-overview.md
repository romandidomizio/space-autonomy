## 📌 **Project Name**

**AegisNav: Agentic Deep-Space Navigation & Autonomous Trajectory Planning**

---

## 🎯 **Project Purpose & Vision**

AegisNav is an **AI-powered, agentic autonomy framework** for **deep-space trajectory planning**, capable of detecting anomalies, adjusting spacecraft paths, and making explainable decisions using real orbital mechanics. It simulates interplanetary mission profiles (e.g., Earth to Mars) using **NASA-grade simulation tools**, **LLM-driven agents**, and **machine learning-based anomaly detection**—all unified in an interactive dashboard.

The project’s goal is to:

* Demonstrate how advanced, explainable AI agents can autonomously manage spacecraft trajectories
* Integrate retrieval-based reasoning with real physics and simulation
* Build a polished, system-level engineering project suitable for elite roles in **AI, autonomy, aerospace, and defense**

## 🧠 **Intended Learning Outcomes for Roman**

1. Understand orbital mechanics and trajectory planning via GMAT
2. Architect agentic systems with LangGraph for autonomous operations
3. Train and evaluate ML anomaly detectors on simulated spacecraft data
4. Apply RAG and LLM fine-tuning (LoRA) for space-reasoning tasks
5. Design dashboards and agent log explainability for human-in-the-loop AI
6. Package and present advanced projects like a systems-level engineer

## 🧩 **System Scope and Capabilities**

### ✅ **Core Capabilities (MVP, \~14 weeks)**

* [ ] Agentic planner: Proposes Earth–Mars trajectory using LangGraph + RAG
* [ ] GMAT execution and result parsing
* [ ] Agentic evaluator: Validates mission parameters (delta-v, time)
* [ ] Anomaly detector (Isolation Forest or TCN): Flags unexpected drift
* [ ] Monitor agent: Replans based on anomaly alert
* [ ] LangSmith logging: Records every decision step, citation, and response
* [ ] Streamlit mission dashboard: Plots trajectory, flags anomalies, logs AI decisions

### 🔧 **Stretch Goals (Advanced, if time allows)**

* [ ] LoRA fine-tuned planning agent (domain-specific trajectory planning)
* [ ] RLHF or Constitutional AI layer for ethical/safety-aligned decisions
* [ ] 3D simulation in Unreal Engine 5 or NVIDIA Omniverse
* [ ] Subsystem-level failure injection (thruster degradation, sensor dropouts)
* [ ] SHAP for anomaly detection interpretability
* [ ] Mission comparison framework (baseline GMAT vs. agentic AI navigation)

## 📈 **Agent Design**

```text
[ Mission Input ] 
      ↓
[ Planner Agent ] → [ GMAT Sim ] → [ Evaluator Agent ]
      ↑                                   ↓
[ RAG + Docs ]                      [ Monitor Agent ] ← [ Anomaly Detector ]
                                          ↓
                                  [ Replanner (loop) ]
                                          ↓
                                 [ Logger → LangSmith ]
```

Each agent has clear, modular logic:

* **Planner** uses constraints + RAG to generate trajectory
* **Evaluator** checks feasibility
* **Monitor** detects mid-course anomaly
* **Replanner** adjusts
* **Logger** records steps, inputs, outputs, rationale

## 🎮 **Visualization & UI Goals**

### Streamlit Interface:

* Live trajectory chart (GMAT path)
* Anomaly flags and agent replan logs
* Full mission timeline (planner → monitor → decision loop)
* Replay mode (view historical runs)
