# AegisNav: Agentic Deep-Space Navigation & Anomaly-Resilient Trajectory Planning

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## üöÄ Overview

AegisNav is an AI-powered, agentic autonomy framework for deep-space trajectory planning. It is designed to autonomously plan, simulate, and adjust spacecraft trajectories under realistic orbital conditions. The system can detect mission anomalies, adapt flight paths safely, and align its decisions with pre-defined mission protocols.

This project serves as a high-fidelity simulation environment for developing and testing autonomous systems for interplanetary missions. It leverages NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) for trajectory simulation, LangGraph for orchestrating a multi-agent AI system, and machine learning for real-time anomaly detection. All operations are visualized in a mission control dashboard built with Streamlit.

The primary use case is an autonomous Earth-to-Mars transfer, where the system must respond to mid-course anomalies (e.g., simulated fuel loss or thruster deviations) by replanning its trajectory without human intervention.

## üß† System Architecture

The system is composed of several key components that work in concert:

-   **Agentic Core (LangGraph)**: A multi-agent system orchestrates the entire workflow.
    -   `Planner Agent`: Proposes an initial trajectory using mission constraints and historical data retrieved via a RAG pipeline.
    -   `Evaluator Agent`: Validates the proposed trajectory against mission requirements (e.g., delta-v budget, arrival time).
    -   `Monitor Agent`: Continuously observes the spacecraft's state during simulation.
    -   `Anomaly Detection Agent`: Uses a machine learning model (e.g., Isolation Forest or a Temporal Convolutional Network) to identify deviations from the planned trajectory.
    -   `Replanning Agent`: Triggers a new planning cycle if an anomaly is detected and confirmed.
-   **Simulation Engine (GMAT)**: NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool provides high-fidelity orbital mechanics simulation.
-   **Mission Control UI (Streamlit)**: An interactive dashboard for visualizing the trajectory, monitoring agent decisions, and reviewing mission logs.
-   **RAG Pipeline (LlamaIndex + ChromaDB)**: Injects domain knowledge from historical mission documents to inform the Planner Agent's decisions.
